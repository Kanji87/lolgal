                    <p class="post__qa-question">Who are you and what class do you play as?</p>
                    <p class="post__qa-answer"><strong>LD: </strong>I am Lady Desiree (dez-er-ray, not to be confused with "desire,"): piano teacher, performer, composer, arranger and video game nerd. I combined my love of video games and piano to arrange video game music - with the music from Destiny being my main focus. I also stream Destiny gameplay on my Twitch channel, and streams of my mеusic is coming soon. I started off as a Hunter, and though nothing is quite as satisfying as a good Fist of Havoc, the Hunter will always be my favorite.</p>
                    <p class="post__qa-question">How would you describe your role in the Destiny Community? Where can we find you?</p>
                    <p class="post__qa-answer"><strong>LD: </strong>If there is a role in our community for a musical, goofy, sarcastic YouTuber/Streamer, I suppose I would fulfill that! I absolutely love getting involved in Destiny Charity streaming events, so if there is a charity event I am usually involved in some capacity. You'll see me active on Twitter in the Destiny community @LadyDesiree00. I am usually streaming during the early afternoon or evening (eastern time) or</p>
                    <p class="post__qa-question">What is your favorite track from Destiny? Can we get an inside tip on what you will cover next?</p>
                    <p class="post__qa-answer"><strong>LD: </strong>That's easy, "Excerpt from the Ecstasy" is hands down my favorite. It was the first track I covered and represents a huge change in my life as I had recently gone through my father's death and the beginning of a divorce. That piece represents hope to me and I love it like no other video game musical theme (and I know a lot). I *still* get teary-eyed when I hear it while in Orbit. As far as what is coming next, I am hoping to cover some new Taken King tracks, but one track that I haven't covered yet that I</p>
